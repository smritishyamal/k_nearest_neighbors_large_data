# k_nearest_neighbors_large_data
For the dataset Poker Hand found on the course website, use the training data consisting of approximately 25,000 examples (out of a domain of about 300,000,000) to classify a testing set using the k nearest neighbor classifier from chapter 2 of the textbook (and described in the lecture notes). Although the test set has 100,000 examples, you will likely find that it will take too long to test that many examples using Python. So it is acceptable to select, say, the first 10,000 examples. You will have to write some code to read the datafile (which is comma delimited) and you will have to modify the distance metric in the function classify0. You must treat the data in two different ways. First, assume that the attributes are numerical. Second, assume that the attributes are nominal. Create a table that indicates the error rate (in percent) for your classification for 10 different values of k = {5, 25, 45, 65, 85, 105, 205, 305, 405, 505}.
